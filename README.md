This is a note taking application, which is a work in progress. It is intended to be exceptionally simple, easy to understand, and user-friendly.

It features the ability to organize notes into a branching tree structure of categories and subcategories. This is accomplished with folders. Folders can hold pages and/or more folders, and they can be nested to any depth.

Current features (As of 07/31/22):

- Creation and navigation of folders and pages to any depth.
- Saving of page title and content (until browser refresh).
- Dark theme toggle.
