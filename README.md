This is a note taking application, which is a work in progress.

The main feature of this app is the simplicity with which the user can create a tree structure of categories and subcategories. This is accomplished via folders.

Folders can hold pages and/or more folders, and they can be nested to any depth.

Current features (As of 07/31/22):

- Creation and navigation of folders and pages to any depth.
- Saving of page title and content (until browser refresh).
- Dark theme toggle.
