This is a note taking web app. It's designed to be exceptionally user-friendly and simple to use.

It features the ability to organize notes into a branching tree of folders and pages.

Folders can hold pages and/or more folders. They can be nested to any depth.

Current features (As of 09/01/22):

- Creation and navigation of folders and pages to any depth.
- Autosaving of all content to the local browser. It uses IndexedDB, so there is no limit to filesize.
- Dark theme toggle.
